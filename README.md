# build-a-quiz-webpage
This project creates an accessible HTML/CSS quiz form. It includes sections for student information, multiple-choice HTML questions, and a CSS question with a dropdown and textarea for comments. The form uses ARIA attributes for accessibility and proper labels for screen readers, with a responsive and semantic structure.
